So I guess you're immune to Mr. Reinhardt?
PORTRAIT_PERSON
That's right! I'm such a good student.
I obey the rules and I never get in trouble.
Not even once!
So yeah, like, I love school!
PORTRAIT_PLAYER
Okay... So...
I was wondering if you could help me out with something?
You see, Reinhardt has stolen something very dear to me.
PORTRAIT_PERSON
wHAT?! Mr. Reinhardt wouldn't steal anything!
You're telling the truth?
PORTRAIT_PLAYER
Of course! He stole my fish and chips!
PORTRAIT_PERSON
Wait wh-
FISH AND CHIPS!?
Sorry, I've got to get ready for class.
