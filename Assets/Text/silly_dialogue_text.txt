You know what happened today?
You know that new kid?
Well I walked right up to him, looked him in the eye.
He looked back at me but he didn't say anything.
I added some extra strength to my stare. 
I was looking at him real mean!
Then I said,
What are you staring at, noob?
And because he's such an idiot, he still didn't say anything!
And once again in this schoolyard right here,
I have successfully asserted my dominance upon another 
unsuspecting new student.
Take that, goblin!
